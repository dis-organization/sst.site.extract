# sst.site.extract

The goal of sst.site.extract is to expose some of the lurking problems in seemingly simple spatial tasks. 

We will: 

* define a number of coastal sites
* access time series of SST data
* find the right pixel for every site (and discover some sites are in the land mask)
* use nearest-neighbour tools to define proxy-sites, the nearest point in valid data for all sites
* optimize the SST lookup and define an extraction loop
* make a mistake after testing the loop with i = 1 and running the entire thing on that first slice
* prevail
